# Chapter 7 - Deep Learning

The experiments in this chapter are based on [examples from DeepLearning4J](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples).

Dataset is [MNIST](https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist).

Instructions to install **DeepLearning4J** are available at DL4J's [QuickStart](https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart.html) page.

The *expt/src* folder in this repository contains source from the DL4J examples with some changes to hyper-parameters and network architecture. The four types of deep learning networks used are:
* Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
* Deep Belief Network (DBN)
* Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
